#### Step 2:

- Replace `nsx_file = p.joinpath("notestation-test-books.nsx")` with your .nsx file  
`nsx_file = p.joinpath("YOUR_NSX_FILE")`

This script is partly based on the great work of @Maboroshy script, which converts a .nsx file into markdown: [Note-Station-to-markdown](https://github.com/Maboroshy/Note-Station-to-markdown)  

Also, it makes use of the very good joplin-api project of @foxmask:
[joplin-api](https://github.com/foxmask/joplin-api)
